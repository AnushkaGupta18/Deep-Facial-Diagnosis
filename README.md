This is an ongoing research-based project on the topic 'Sentiment Analysis of Kindle Store Reviews on Amazon'. 

The increasing popularity of e-books has led to a significant growth in the number of e-books available in the market. With the increasing competition in the e-book market, it has become essential for e-book sellers like Amazon to understand the opinions and sentiments of their customers towards their products to enhance their customer experience and increase their sales.

Sentiment analysis is a popular technique used to extract and quantify opinions and sentiments from large amounts of textual data. Therefore, conducting sentiment analysis of Kindle Store reviews on Amazon for e-books can help in understanding the customers' opinions towards the e-books available on the platform.

This research project aims to explore the sentiments expressed by customers in their reviews of e-books in the Kindle Store on Amazon. By analyzing the sentiments, the paper will identify the most common sentiments expressed by customers and the factors that influence their sentiments. The findings of this research can be useful to e-book sellers on Amazon to improve their marketing strategies, enhance their customer experience, and increase their sales.

Some of the machine learning/deep learning techniques that we plan on exploring in this project are: 
1. Logistic Regression 
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes 
3. LinearSVC
4. Convolutional Neural Networks 
5. LSTM 
6. GRU 

We also plan on incorporating a pre-trained transformer-based deep learning architecture, BERT, into our project.
